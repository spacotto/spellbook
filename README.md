## Characters
### Output
Given a character (or its corresponding `int` value), these functions write an output.

`ft_putchar`
>Given an ASCII character (or its corresponding)

### Check
Given an `int`, these functions check if the corresponding character belongs to a certain ASCII category (e.g., alphabetic, digit).

`ft_isalpha`
>Checks if a character is an alphabet (a-z, A-Z).

`ft_isdigit`
>Checks if a character is a decimal digit (0-9).

`ft_isalnum`
>Checks if a character is alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).

`ft_isascii`
>Checks if a character is a 7-bit ASCII character.

`ft_isprint`
>Checks if a character is printable, including space.

## Counters
Given a set of data, these functions count the elements belonging to said set.

`ft_countdigits`
>Given a signed number and its base, it counts the digits composing it.

`ft_countwords`
>Given a string and a separator, it counts how many words are in the string.

## Conversions
These functions convert data.

### Characters to Characters
`ft_toupper`
>Converts a lowercase letter to its uppercase equivalent.

`ft_tolower`
>Converts an uppercase letter to its lowercase equivalent.

### Numbers to Written Output
`ft_putnbr`
>Converts a signed number to the corresponding written output.

`ft_putnbr_base`
>Converts a signed number to the corresponding written output according to its base.

### Arguments to Numbers
`ft_atoi`
>Converts a string to an integer.

### Numbers to Arguments
`ft_itoa`
>Allocates memory and converts a number to a string.

`ft_itoa_base`
>Allocates memory and converts a number to a string according to its base.

`ft_utoa`
>Allocates memory and converts an unsigned int to a string.

`ft_utoa_base`
>Allocates memory and converts an unsigned number to a string according to its base.

## String Manipulation
This category includes functions for handling strings. They are used for copying, comparing, and searching within data.

`ft_strlen`
>Calculates the length of a string, excluding the null terminator.

`ft_strlcpy`
>Copies a string with a size limit, ensuring the destination is null-terminated.

`ft_strlcat`
>Appends a string with a size limit, ensuring the destination is null-terminated.

>Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.

`ft_strncmp`
>Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.

`ft_strnstr`
>Locates the first occurrence of a substring within a string, searching up to a specified length.

`ft_strdup`
>Duplicates a string by allocating new memory and copying the contents.

`ft_substr`

`ft_strjoin`
>Allocates memory and returns a new string, which is the result of concatenating `s1` and `s2`.

`ft_strtrim`
>Allocates memory and returns a copy of `s1` with characters from `set` removed from the beginning and the end.

`ft_split`
>Allocates memory and returns an array of strings obtained by splitting `s` using the character `c` as a delimiter.

`ft_striteri`
>Applies the function `f` to each character of the string passed as argument. It acts directly on the source.

`ft_strmapi`
>Applies the function `f` to each character of the string passed as argument, and returns a new string as a result.

## Memory Manipulation
This category includes functions for handling blocks of memory. They are used for copying, comparing, and searching within data.

`ft_memset`
>Fills a block of memory with a specific byte value.

| `ft_calloc`   | Allocates a block of memory for an array and initialises all bytes to zero. |

## File Descriptor Functions
These functions write various data types to a specified file descriptor, which can be a file, standard output, or standard error. They are a common way to handle I/O in a modular and consistent manner.
| Function Name   | Description                                                                    |

| `ft_putstr_fd`  | Outputs the string `s` to the specified file descriptor.                       |
| `ft_putendl_fd` | Outputs the string `s` to the specified file descriptor followed by a newline. |
| `ft_putnbr_fd`  | Outputs the integer `n` to the specified file descriptor.                      |

## Linked Lists
These functions are specifically designed to teach you the basics of **linked lists**, a fundamental data structure in computer science. They teach you the creation, deletion, modification, and iteration of individual list nodes (or "links") and the list as a whole. All these functions are based on the same given structure.
| Function Name     | Description                                                                                                                                    |

| `ft_lstsize`      | Counts the number of nodes in the list.                                                                                                        |
| `ft_lstlast`      | Returns the last node of the list.                                                                                                             |

| `ft_lstdelone`    | Takes a node as a parameter and frees its content using the function `del`. Free the node itself, but does NOT free the next node.             |
| `ft_lstclear`     | Deletes and frees the given node and all its successors, using the function `del` and `free(3)`. Finally, set the pointer to the list to NULL. |
| `ft_lstiter`      | Iterates through the list `lst` and applies the function `f` to the content of each node.                                                      |
| `ft_lstmap`       | Iterates through the list `lst`, applies the function `f` to each node’s content, and creates a new list as a result.                          |
> [!TIP]
> The order of the functions follows a specific logic. Pay attention to it!

## Variadic Functions
Functions that take a variable number of arguments.
| Function Name     | Description                                                                                                                         |
